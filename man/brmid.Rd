\title{Interface for infectious disease modelling using brms.}
\usage{
idbrm(data, formula, family, priors, custom_stancode, dry = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame as prepared for modelling using \code{prepare} with a
class associated with the model prepared for.}

\item{formula}{A formula as defined using \code{id_formula} or as supported by
\code{brms::brm}.}

\item{family}{A observation model family as defined in \code{brms}.}

\item{priors}{A list of priors as defined using \code{brms} or \code{id_priors}.
Defaults to the the \code{id_priors} defined for the model class being fit.}

\item{custom_stancode}{A list of \code{stanvars} used to define custom stancode
in \code{brms}. By default uses the code designed for the model class being fit
(as specified using \code{id_stancode}).}

\item{dry}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. For testing purposes should just the
\code{stan} code be output with not fitting done.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{brms::brm}.}
}
